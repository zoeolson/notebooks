The first of the two contains code about the design of the web app, such as number of panels, layout, sliders, etc.  The server.r code contains methods for getting the data in and displaying graphics such as charts, plots, and interactive 3-D visualizations. \n",

    "The R project has decided to take its own route in exploring 'literate computing'. The project originally accomodated for Ipython notebooks, and has continued to provide support for Jupyter notebook accomodation. However, R-Studio developed it's own version of a notebook, called R-markdown, which is very similar to Jupyter, except for the fact that it is specialized for R. This created some tension between Jupyter developers and R-Studio developers around the notion that R developers continued to develop the langauge, and tools for the langauge, in such a way that separates R from other statistical computing langagues. Arguably, this positions R as the \"best\" statistical programming langague and toolset. This move also creates the need to compare, and essentially 'rank', these toolsets against eachother, rather than incorporate them into a fluid computing environment. \n",
